            I’m TeTo, BSc graduate in Cybersecurity from UniMi, based in Milan (Italy). I spend most of my time exploring web security and tackling CTF challenges on weekends. This is my personal corner to share write-ups, projects, and interesting discoveries along the way.

            It also helps me track my progress, stay motivated, and occasionally remind myself not to procrastinate too much.
